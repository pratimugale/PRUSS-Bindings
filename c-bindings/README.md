This code is not a part of the APIs and was made in the initial stages only as a short excercise to understand the structure of `cpp-bindings` in detail. This should not be used because of no OOP support. (Code can control one PRU).<br>
The interface to control PRUs is provided in [cpp-bindings](https://github.com/pratimugale/PRUSS-Bindings/tree/master/cpp-bindings).
