# Software Generation of Multichannel PWM.

Software generation of PWM requires a certain amount of processing time to manage the signal level decision process, so it is only suitable for low base frequency waveform generation. 
Signals of this type are suitable for DC control applications such as LED or lamp intensity control, brush-type DC motor speed control, analogue meter driving, or any situation requiring a low-dynamic DC control voltage.

Since the PRU can operate at a considerably high frequency, multiple channels can be generated with good precision.
